# "X" is "remove", which kills a split, but small "x" is lock which is
# not only useless, but kills all splits once you log back in:
bind x remove

# similarly, "s" is the useless and deeply problematic "xoff" command (which
# effectively locks your window), but "S" is the useful "split" so make
# both "s" and "S" "split"
bind s split
